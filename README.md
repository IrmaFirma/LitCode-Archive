# 📚 LitCode Blog Archive
"Every end is a new beginning."

Welcome to the archived repository of LitCode, my personal blog and creative coding space I started back in February 2022 as a high school project.

🕰️ About LitCode
LitCode was a four-year-long journey where I explored and shared everything I was learning about:

💻 Web Development & Web Design

🧠 Programming Fundamentals

🧪 Tech Concepts & Computer Science

✍️ Tutorials, Articles, and Quizzes

Over time, LitCode reached a readership of 500+ daily visitors, and I used my Instagram page @thelitcode to share bite-sized tech content and connect with other learners.

📁 What's in This Repository?
This repo contains a single PDF file compiling all my LitCode blog posts — a full archive of my work from high school.

Think of it as a digital time capsule — the lessons, the voice, the growth, all preserved.

🚀 Moving On: FirmaCodes
As I step into the next phase of my journey, I'm saying goodbye to LitCode and hello to something bigger: FirmaCodes — my new platform where I’ll be building real-world projects, offering design and dev services, writing even better tech content, and hopefully creating even more impact.

🙏 Thank You
To everyone who read, shared, or learned something through LitCode — thank you. This project taught me so much about consistency, design, frontend development, and connecting with a community through code.

📌 Note: This repository is no longer maintained.
If you're curious about what I'm working on now, head over to FirmaCodes or find me on Instagram @firmacodes
